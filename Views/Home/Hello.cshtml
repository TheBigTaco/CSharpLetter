    <h1>Hello From Afar</h1>
    <p>Dear @Model.GetRecipient(),</p>
    <p>How are you? I hope that you are having a nice weekend. I'm vacationing in @Model.GetVacation() while I learn programming! </p>
    <p>@Model.GetRecipient(), you would not believe how cold it is here. I should have gone to Hawaii instead.</p>
    <p>But I like programming a lot, so I've got that going for me. </p>
    <p>Looking forward to seeing you soon. I'll bring you back a @Model.GetSouvenir(). </p>
    <p>Cheers,</p>
    <p>Travel Enthusiast Jane</p>
